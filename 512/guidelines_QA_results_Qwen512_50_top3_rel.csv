Should tumor depth be included in prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma?,no,no,"Most staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma are based on histologic malignancy-grade, tumor size and tumor depth. These factors are generally dichotomized, size at 5 cm. We believe it is unlikely that tumor depth per se should influence a tumor's metastatic capability. Therefore we hypothesized that the unfavourable prognostic importance of depth could be explained by the close association between size and depth, deep-seated tumors on average being larger than the superficial ones",0.5,". In this subset deep-seated tumors had poorer survival rate than superficial tumors, which could be explained by the larger mean size of the deep-seated tumors.",0.5,". When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger.

Partial prostatectomy after preoperative chemoradiotherapy resulted in a free anterior CRM in all cases, but intra-operative urethral damage occurred in 36.4% of patients who underwent partial prostatectomy, resulting in a postoperative urinary fistula in 18.2% of patients.",0.32322362065315247
Does patient position during liver surgery influence the risk of venous air embolism?,no,no,". The incidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis in internal patients during hospitalisation was 39/6332 (0.6%). Among these 39 patients, 24 had a malignancy, whereas 876 out of all 6332 patients had a known malignancy. So, the incidence in this group with cancer was 2.7% compared with 0.3% (15/5456) in the non-cancer group (relative risk for venous thrombosis due to malignancy was 10.0 (95%C.I. 5.3-18.9).",0.9883084297180176,". There was no demonstrable pressure gradient between the hepatic and central venous levels in any of the positions. The absolute pressures did, however, vary in a predictable way, being highest in the head-down and lowest during head-up tilt. However, on no occasion was a negative intraluminal pressure recorded.",0.5835834741592407,". 05 considered significant). The results showed that systolic blood pressure at 15, 20, 30 minutes and CVP at 15, 25, 30 minutes after positioning in the study group was maintained significantly compared to the control group and there were no significant changes in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. There were no other complications during the sitting period.",0.5
Do Indigenous Australians age prematurely?,yes,no,". There is high prevalence from middle-age onwards of some conditions, particularly diabetes (type unspecified), but there is little or no lead for others.",0.5037902593612671,"To assess whether Indigenous Australians age prematurely compared with other Australians, as implied by Australian Government aged care policy, which uses age 50 years and over for population-based planning for Indigenous people compared with 70 years for non-indigenous people.

Are tuberculosis patients adherent to prescribed treatments in China?,no,maybe,". Only 13.9 % of patients took drugs under direct observation, and 60.5 % of patients were supervised by phone calls. Factor analyses suggested that patients who were observed by family members (OR:5.54, 95 % CI:2.87-10.69) and paying monthly service expenses above 450 RMB (OR:2.08, 95 % CI:1.35-3.19) were more likely to be non-adherent, while supervision by home visit (OR:0.06, 95 % CI:0.01-0.28) and phone calls (OR:0.27, 95 % CI:0.17-0.44) were protective factors.",0.7481100559234619,". Complete response was defined as a resolution of symptoms and active tuberculosis by colonoscopy. Complete response was obtained in all patients in both groups. Two patients in the 9-month group and one in the 15-month group underwent operation due to intestinal obstruction and perianal fistula, respectively. No recurrence of active intestinal tuberculosis occurred during the follow-up period in either group.",0.6225945949554443,. A prospective cohort of 481 newly confirmed TB patients from three counties in western China were enrolled during June to December 2012 and was followed until June 2013. Patients who missed at least one dose of drugs or one follow-up re-examination during the treatment course were deemed as non-adherent. Influencing factors were identified using a logistic regression model. A total of 173 (36.0 %) patients experienced non-adherence and the loss to follow-up cases reached 136 (28.2 %),0.5
Ultrasound in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis; a useful addition to clinical staging?,no,yes,". All tumors were identified as hypoechoic lesions. Ultrasound examination in the region of the glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, but absence or presence of invasion into the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum was clearly demonstrated. Accurate measurement by ultrasound of maximum tumor thickness was seen in seven of sixteen examinations.",0.5117943286895752,"As part of the staging procedure in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, we assessed the role of ultrasound examination, in particular its role in assessing the extent and the invasion into the corpora. From 1988 until 1992, all patients referred for primary treatment underwent ultrasound assessment with a 7.5 MHz linear array small parts transducer as part of the clinical workup",0.5,". Cytotechnologists demonstrate statistically better performance for the general category of ""positive-malignant"" compared with pathologists for all urinary slide types and for the exact reference interpretation of HGUCA (94% versus 91.1%; P<.001) but not adenocarcinoma (96.3% versus 95.8%; P = .77) or squamous cell carcinoma (93.6% versus 87.7%; P = .07).",0.485134094953537
Do oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents?,no,no,"Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique lumbar spine radiographs are often a standard part of the evaluation of children who are clinically suspected of having spondylolysis. Recent concerns regarding radiation exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis",0.5,". Fractures without rotational deformity or coronal angulation and with a shaft-condylar angle of>15 degrees were more likely to be associated with successful nonsurgical treatment. A scoring system was developed using these features to stratify the severity of the injury. Patients with isolated extension deformity, but none of the other features, were more likely to complete successful nonoperative management.",0.5,". 162 of 248 bones were fractured. 130 fractures were identified using ultrasound, and 148 using X-ray. There were some advantages of X-ray over ultrasound in the detection of fracture type (80 correct results using X-ray, 66 correct results using ultrasound). Ultrasound, however, was superior to X-ray for dislocation identification (41 correct results using X-ray, 51 correct results using ultrasound). Both findings were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing.",0.4366612732410431
Are many colorectal cancers due to missed adenomas?,yes,no,. Assuming that these cancers developed from an adenoma than only 11 out of 835 (1.3%) cancers were missed in the adenoma phase. There was no difference in the size of the tumour between the three groups of patients.,0.7191934585571289,"An unknown number of colorectal cancers could be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopy. Data in the literature are sparse. A large cross-sectional study was done in a prospective database of all patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. All consecutive endoscopies over a period of 15 years, in which colorectal cancer was diagnosed were included. All patients who underwent more than one endoscopy and in whom ultimately cancer was diagnosed were studied separately",0.5,". One hundred patients (aged 61.8±13.3 y, 54.1% females), underwent an early (4 to 6 wk) colonoscopy after hospital discharge. There were no significant differences in patients' characteristics or survival between those with or without colonoscopy (4±1.9 vs. 4.2±2.1 y, P=0.62). No colonic malignancy was detected. However, in 32 patients (32%) at least 1 polyp was found. Only 1 was determined as an advanced adenoma. No new or different diagnosis was made after colonoscopy.",0.2718013823032379
Does desflurane alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery?,yes,no,". No change in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening was noted when desflurane was added to restore blood pressure.",0.7630884647369385,"Although desflurane is commonly used to control surgically induced hypertension, its effects on left ventricular (LV) function have not been investigated in this clinical situation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the LV function response to desflurane, when used to control intraoperative hypertension.

There existed no significant difference in echocardiographic parameters between before and after device implantation. However, a larger left atrial (LA) diameter was detected by echocardiography during follow-up visit at 6months when compared with pre-operation parameters. Similarly, aortic root diameter (ARD) was also larger during follow-up at 12months than the baseline dimension in pre-operation.",0.28668010234832764
Does gestational age misclassification explain the difference in birthweights for Australian aborigines and whites?,no,no,". At preterm, the 10th centiles were robust to misclassification. In contrast, the 90th centiles were sensitive to even minor misclassification. Extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the divergence in median birthweights for Aborigines and whites.",0.9952722787857056,"After 34 weeks gestation, summary measures of location for birthweight (e.g means and centiles) increase more slowly for Australian Aborigines than for whites. A similar pattern has been observed for blacks in the US. This study tests whether the reported pattern is due to differential misclassification of gestational age. Simulation was used to measure the potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age",0.5,". The women were also divided into two groups according to the gestational age one group included 414 women in 24-37 weeks gestation, and the other group included 286 women in term pregnancy. No difference was found in the rate of GBS carriers between the two gestational age groups.",0.4831906855106354
Is there any interest to perform ultrasonography in boys with undescended testis?,no,no,". The results of the ultrasonogram were compared to the results of the clinical examination of the paediatric surgeon and, in cases of no palpable testis, to the surgical findings. Ultrasonography did not detect the retractile testes. Ultrasonography detected 67% of the palpable undescended testes. In cases of no palpable testis, the ultrasonographic examination missed the abdominal testes and sometimes other structures were falsely interpreted as a testis.",0.967585563659668,"To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonographic examination in boys with an undescended testis. All patients who were referred to the paediatric surgeon after detection of an undescended testis were evaluated prospectively between November 2001 and November 2004. Among these 377 patients, 87 were referred with an ultrasonogram previously prescribed by the referring primary physician",0.5,To determine the advantages of scrotal incision in the treatment of undescended testis. Undescended testis is a common pediatric condition and is conventionally managed surgically by orchidopexy.
