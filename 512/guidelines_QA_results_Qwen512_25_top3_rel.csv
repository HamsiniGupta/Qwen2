Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?,yes,yes,"Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature",0.75,". The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.",0.6455286145210266,". However, the cold-induced modifications in the cell wall properties were more pronounced in the leaves of the more pathogen-resistant genotype. De-acclimation promoted leaf expansion and reversed most of the cold-induced effects, with the exception of pectin methylesterase activity.",0.291442334651947

We employed a retrospective survey methodology to investigate factors associated with deaths by injury and poisoning among young men aged 15-39 years (n = 268) in Merseyside and Cheshire during 1995",0.75,". Dividing fractures into stable and unstable types allowed the system to predict mortality rates, abdomen injury rates, and transfusion requirements. Overall mortality in the study group was 9.1%, unchanged from original Young-Burgess studies 15 years previously (P = 0.3).",0.4375341534614563,". Of the 559 cases analyzed, 60.15% were males. A sustained increase was observed in the trend since 2008 in males (p<0,05), especially at the expense of males who had no history of food poisoning or travel to endemic areas. The increasing tendency was greater in males from 21 to 60 years, both for S. flexneri (since 2009), and for S. sonnei (since 2004). In 2012 it was noted that in the men with S. flexneri, the 63% were men who have sex with men.",0.3262183964252472
Continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration: opportunity for rescue?,no,maybe,To determine the duration of continuing pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid (AC) administration and to evaluate the potential opportunity for rescue AC. Retrospective analysis of women at 24-32 weeks' gestation who received AC at one institution. Six hundred ninety-two women received AC. Two hundred forty-seven (35.7%) delivered at>or = 34 weeks' gestation. Three hundred twenty-one (46.4%) delivered within 1 week of AC; 92 of those women (13.3%) delivered within 24 hours,0.75,".

Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects?,yes,yes,"The pressures delivered by autotitrating continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) devices not only treat obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) effectively but also give potentially interesting physiological information about the forces impinging on the pharynx. In earlier work from this unit, we used correlations between autoCPAP pressure and both OSA severity and obesity, to construct an algorithm to estimate the fixed CPAP pressure a patient required for subsequent clinical use",0.75,". We wished to discover if these relationships could be reliably extended to a much more obese group. We performed a prospective cohort study in an obese population. Measurements of obesity were made, OSA severity was recorded, and the 95th centile autoCPAP pressure was recorded during 1Â week of autoCPAP. Spearman's rank correlation was performed between measurements of obesity and autoCPAP pressure, and between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure",0.5954765677452087,". Fifty-four obese individuals (median body mass index (BMI) 43.0Â kg/m(2)), 52Â % of whom had OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)â€‰â‰¥â€‰15), had a median 95th centile autoCPAP pressure of 11.8â€‰cmH2O. We found no significant correlation between autoCPAP pressure and neck circumference, waist circumference or BMI. There was a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA severity (AHI râ€‰=â€‰0.34, pâ€‰=â€‰0.02; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) râ€‰=â€‰0.48, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001).",0.531017541885376
Does the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth predict risk in a subsequent pregnancy?,yes,yes,"The objective of the study was to determine whether risk of recurrent preterm birth differs based on the clinical presentation of a prior spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB): advanced cervical dilatation (ACD), preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), or preterm labor (PTL). This retrospective cohort study included singleton pregnancies from 2009 to 2014 complicated by a history of prior SPTB",0.75,". Women were categorized based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm delivery as having ACD, PPROM, or PTL. Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth.

Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling?,yes,yes,". The patients involved were schizophrenic or bipolar, mostly young men with a history of addictive disorders and regular gambling prior to the prescription of aripiprazole. For each one of them, the causality of aripiprazole was considered, using an algorithm. The probability that pathological gambling is actually due to aripiprazole is ""possible"" in 7 cases out of 8, and ""doubtful"" in one.",0.8330292701721191,"It is commonly accepted that pathological gambling results from the interaction of multiple risk factors. Among these, dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) prescribed for Parkinson disease can be cited. Another dopamine agonist, aripiprazole, could be a new risk factor. We decided to explore this potential adverse drug reaction (ADR). Based on a cohort of 166 pathological gamblers starting treatment in our department, data of each of the 8 patients treated by aripiprazole at inclusion were analyzed",0.75,". We propose that the RBC EPA + DHA (hereafter called the Omega-3 Index) be considered a new risk factor for death from CHD. We conducted clinical and laboratory experiments to generate data necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor.

Immune suppression by lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine on T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens: does synergy exist?,yes,yes,"Using murine models, we have shown that the lysosomotropic amine, chloroquine, is effective in the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) mediated by donor T cells reactive with recipient minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHCs). Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine",0.75,. We investigated the use of cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice. We found that similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress the T-cell response to MiHC in mice (C57BL/6 anti-BALB.B) and that lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine result in synergistic suppression of a proliferative response to MiHC,0.5841328501701355,". This effect does not appear to be due to decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma. At lower concentrations (<25 microg/ml), chloroquine can also decrease the ability of antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an a C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c T-cell response and can inhibit MHC class II expression after activation with lipopolysaccharide.",0.41247236728668213
Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,yes,yes,To assess the outcomes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) whose treatment was determined by computerized tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging staging and to analyze the impact of induction chemotherapy and accelerated fractionated radiotherapy.

Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more?,yes,maybe,"Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele",0.75,. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective. We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006,0.679353654384613,. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up.,0.5011495351791382

Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery?,no,maybe,"A prospective randomized clinical study. To determine whether shaving the incision site before spinal surgery causes postsurgical infection. Spine surgeons usually shave the skin of the incision site immediately before surgery is performed. However, evidence from some surgical series suggests that presurgical shaving may increase the postsurgical infection rate. To our knowledge, no previously published studies have addressed this issue",0.75,. A total of 789 patients scheduled to undergo spinal surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups: those in whom the site of operation was shaved immediately before surgery (shaved group; 371 patients) and the patients in whom presurgical shaving was not performed (unshaved group; 418 patients). The mean duration of anesthesia and the infection rates in both groups were recorded and compared. The duration of anesthesia did not differ in the 2 groups (P>0.05),0.3142807185649872,.

The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important?,yes,maybe,"The rate of aortic aneurysm rupture correlates with the aneurysm's diameter, and a higher rate of rupture is observed in patients with larger aneurysms. According to the literature, contradictory results concerning the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm size have been reported.AIM: In this paper, we assessed the influence of changes in atmospheric pressure on abdominal aneurysm ruptures in relationship to the aneurysm's size",0.75,". There were no statistically significant differences in pressure between the days of rupture and the remainder of the days within an analysed period. The highest frequency of the admission of patients with a ruptured aortic aneurysm was observed during periods of winter and spring, when the highest mean values of atmospheric pressure were observed; however, this observation was not statistically confirmed",0.4314500689506531,. A statistically non-significant trend towards the higher rupture of large aneurysms (>7 cm) was observed in the cases where the pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture.

The importance and interactions of each factor were determined, at the group level, by performing analyses of variance and constructing graphs. The concept of breaching confidentiality to protect a wife from her husband's STD was favoured much more by lay people and psychologists than by physicians (mean ratings 11.76, 9.28 and 2.90, respectively, on a scale of 0-22). The patient's stated intentions to protect his wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability",0.3181021511554718
Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?,yes,maybe,". Baseline scores on the SCL-90-R somatization subscale significantly predicted subsequent self-reported symptoms of depressed mood 5 years later, but only in women. However, somatic complaints were a somewhat less powerful predictor than income and age.",0.9227378368377686,"Evidence suggests substantial comorbidity between symptoms of somatization and depression in clinical as well as nonclinical populations. However, as most existing research has been retrospective or cross-sectional in design, very little is known about the specific nature of this relationship. In particular, it is unclear whether somatic complaints may heighten the risk for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms",0.75,". It was related significantly to symptoms of depression (r = .81, P<.005), anxiety (r = .66, P<.005), and subjective complaints of memory problems (r = .75, P<.005).

Identification of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality: does scale matter?,yes,yes,"This paper investigates the impact of geographic scale (census tract, zip code, and county) on the detection of disparities in breast cancer mortality among three ethnic groups in Texas (period 1995-2005). Racial disparities were quantified using both relative (RR) and absolute (RD) statistics that account for the population size and correct for unreliable rates typically observed for minority groups and smaller geographic units",0.75,". ""Potential vaccine uptake"" was defined as the sum of actual vaccine uptake and ""missed opportunities."" The frequency of ""missed opportunities"" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings was significantly higher among racial and ethnic minorities than non-Hispanic whites. Eliminating these ""missed opportunities"" could have cut racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination by roughly one half.",0.4296359419822693,.

Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients?,no,yes,"Disorders of consciousness (DOC) diagnosis relies on the presence or absence of purposeful motor responsiveness, which characterizes the minimally conscious state (MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), respectively. Functional neuroimaging studies have raised the question of possible residual conscious awareness also in clinically-defined UWS patients",0.75,". Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients.",0.5387270450592041,". The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed.

Locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy: a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy?,yes,yes,Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy (LITT) of rat brains is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability changes. We address the question of whether LITT-induced locoregional disruption of the BBB could possibly allow a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into brain tissue to treat malignant glioma.STUDY DESIGN/ CD Fischer rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH),0.75,". Animals were perfused with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples. LITT induces an opening of the BBB as demonstrated by locoregional extravasation of Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM. HPLC proved the passage of paclitaxel across the disrupted BBB.",0.5271538496017456,". This improvement was more evident in the ischemic and normal groups treated with combined therapy.

Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organs input?,no,yes,"To clarify whether horizontal canal ocular reflex is influenced by otolith organs input. The subjects were seven healthy humans. The right ear was stimulated using ice-water. Each subject was kept in a left-ear-down position for 20 s and then repositioned to a prone position, a right-ear-down position and a supine position with 20 s intervals. Nystagmus was analysed using three-dimensional video-oculography. Eye movements in the supine position and the prone position were not in a symmetric fashion",0.75,. Nystagmus in the left-ear-down position and the right-ear-down position were not symmetric either. These phenomena indicate that the axis of the eyeball rotation was affected by the shift of the direction of gravity exerted on the head.,0.25,". Anterior chamber depth in eyes with pseudoexfoliation decreased from a mean of 3.08 mm in the supine position to a mean of 2.95 mm in the prone position, whereas mean anterior chamber depth in the fellow eyes decreased from 3.01 mm to 2.97 mm.

Is perforation of the appendix a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy?,yes,maybe,To critically assess the evidence that appendiceal perforation is a risk factor for subsequent tubal infertility or ectopic pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies investigating the relationship between appendectomy and infertility or ectopic pregnancy were identified by searching the MEDLINE database from 1966 to 1997. Appropriate citations were also extracted from a manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. Twenty-three articles were retrieved,0.75,. Articles were assessed according to the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility from perforation of the appendix,0.6425646543502808,".

Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement?,yes,no,"Unicompartmental replacement can be an alternative to tibial osteotomy in younger, active patients with unicompartmental knee disease. In unicompartmental replacement, the other compartments and knee ligaments are largely untouched. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the knee kinematics after unicompartmental replacement may also be unchanged",0.75,". To test this hypothesis, knee kinematics and quadriceps tension were recorded before and after replacement with a unicompartmental design and then with a tricompartmental design. Six human cadaver knees were tested before implantation, after implantation with a bicruciate-retaining unicompartmental knee prosthesis, and after implantation with a posterior cruciate-retaining tricompartmental knee prosthesis",0.5655361413955688,".

Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa?,yes,yes,"Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis involving mainly medium-sized arteries and, rarely, small-sized arteries. The diagnosis is principally based on clinical exams, biopsy of an affected organ, and/or arteriography of renal or mesenteric arteries. Once diagnosed, immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, are generally introduced as soon as possible. Whether spontaneous remission of PAN occurs is therefore largely unknown",0.75,". A possible diagnosis of PAN was considered; however, within 2 weeks of admission, spontaneous remission of her clinical and biological symptoms occurred without the use of any immunosuppressive treatment.

Should tumor depth be included in prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma?,no,no,"Most staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma are based on histologic malignancy-grade, tumor size and tumor depth. These factors are generally dichotomized, size at 5 cm. We believe it is unlikely that tumor depth per se should influence a tumor's metastatic capability. Therefore we hypothesized that the unfavourable prognostic importance of depth could be explained by the close association between size and depth, deep-seated tumors on average being larger than the superficial ones",0.75,". When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger.

Could chest wall rigidity be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse?,yes,yes,". The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2â€‰ng/ml) in apparent non-naÃ¯ve opiate abusers. Acute chest wall rigidity is a well-recognized complication in the medical community but unknown within the drug abuse community",0.75,There has been a significant spike in fentanyl-related deaths from illicit fentanyl supplied via the heroin trade. Past fentanyl access was primarily oral or dermal via prescription fentanyl patch diversion. One factor potentially driving this increase in fatalities is the change in route of administration.

Patients who missed at least one dose of drugs or one follow-up re-examination during the treatment course were deemed as non-adherent. Influencing factors were identified using a logistic regression model. A total of 173 (36.0 %) patients experienced non-adherence and the loss to follow-up cases reached 136 (28.2 %),0.75,". MRI scan rates were higher in younger patients (26% vs 4%, p<0.01), as was carotid Doppler imaging (92% vs 77%, p<0.01). There were no differences in prescribed secondary preventive treatments. Older patients experienced less delay for carotid endarterectomy (49 vs 90 days, p<0.01). Younger patients were more likely to be given advice on weight reduction (30.2% vs 12.9%, p<0.01) and diet (46.3% vs 31.7%, p = 0.02) than older patients.",0.6442275643348694,". Complete response was defined as a resolution of symptoms and active tuberculosis by colonoscopy. Complete response was obtained in all patients in both groups.

Five-year survival by general T status was 66% in T1N0 vs 55% in T2N0 disease (P=0.19).",0.30814114212989807
Do oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents?,no,no,"Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique lumbar spine radiographs are often a standard part of the evaluation of children who are clinically suspected of having spondylolysis. Recent concerns regarding radiation exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis",0.75,". Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides",0.4410354495048523,". Radiographs of fifty adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scanning",0.3399214744567871
Are many colorectal cancers due to missed adenomas?,no,no,"An unknown number of colorectal cancers could be due to missed adenomas during previous endoscopy. Data in the literature are sparse. A large cross-sectional study was done in a prospective database of all patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. All consecutive endoscopies over a period of 15 years, in which colorectal cancer was diagnosed were included. All patients who underwent more than one endoscopy and in whom ultimately cancer was diagnosed were studied separately",0.75,. Assuming that these cancers developed from an adenoma than only 11 out of 835 (1.3%) cancers were missed in the adenoma phase. There was no difference in the size of the tumour between the three groups of patients.,0.5787901878356934,". A retrospective audit was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal and node-positive breast cancers during a 24-month period. Fisher's exact test was used for analysis. Rurality was determined as per rural, remote and metropolitan classification. Of the 121 patients included, 70 and 51 patients had breast and colon cancers respectively. The urban versus rural patient split among all patients, breast and colorectal cancer subgroups was 68 versus 53, 43 versus 27 and 25 versus 26 respectively",0.2814842164516449
Does desflurane alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical stimulation during aortic surgery?,no,no,"Although desflurane is commonly used to control surgically induced hypertension, its effects on left ventricular (LV) function have not been investigated in this clinical situation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the LV function response to desflurane, when used to control intraoperative hypertension. In 50 patients, scheduled for vascular surgery, anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.5 microg/kg, midazolam 0.3 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg",0.75,".

Does gestational age misclassification explain the difference in birthweights for Australian aborigines and whites?,no,no,". At preterm, the 10th centiles were robust to misclassification. In contrast, the 90th centiles were sensitive to even minor misclassification. Extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the divergence in median birthweights for Aborigines and whites.",0.9929083585739136,"After 34 weeks gestation, summary measures of location for birthweight (e.g means and centiles) increase more slowly for Australian Aborigines than for whites. A similar pattern has been observed for blacks in the US. This study tests whether the reported pattern is due to differential misclassification of gestational age. Simulation was used to measure the potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age",0.75,". The women were also divided into two groups according to the gestational age one group included 414 women in 24-37 weeks gestation, and the other group included 286 women in term pregnancy. No difference was found in the rate of GBS carriers between the two gestational age groups.",0.3807191252708435
Is there any interest to perform ultrasonography in boys with undescended testis?,no,no,". The results of the ultrasonogram were compared to the results of the clinical examination of the paediatric surgeon and, in cases of no palpable testis, to the surgical findings. Ultrasonography did not detect the retractile testes. Ultrasonography detected 67% of the palpable undescended testes. In cases of no palpable testis, the ultrasonographic examination missed the abdominal testes and sometimes other structures were falsely interpreted as a testis.",0.951378345489502,"To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonographic examination in boys with an undescended testis. All patients who were referred to the paediatric surgeon after detection of an undescended testis were evaluated prospectively between November 2001 and November 2004.
